# Car Dataset Analysis

This project is an analysis of a car dataset that contains information about car makers, models, and configurations. The dataset includes the following headers:

* Make
* Model
* Type
* Origin
* DriveTrain
* MSRP
* Invoice
* EngineSize
* Cylinders
* Horsepower
* MPG_City
* MPG_Highway
* Weight
* Wheelbase
* Length

## Analysis
During the analysis, the following steps were taken:

* Checked for null values in the dataset and fixed them if any were found.
* Analyzed the car makers in the dataset and identified the most popular ones.
* Grouped the cars by origin and analyzed the distribution of cars by region.
* Filtered the cars by weight to identify cars that were lighter or heavier than average.
* Analyzed the MPG_City variable to identify the most fuel-efficient cars.

## Conclusion
The car dataset provides valuable information about car makers, models, and configurations. The analysis showed that the dataset contains a diverse range of cars, with a variety of weights, fuel efficiencies, and origins. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into the car industry and make informed decisions about the types of cars we want to buy.
